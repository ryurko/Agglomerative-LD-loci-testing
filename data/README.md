# Overview of data

This folder is meant contain the files necessary for analysis, as well as store
the results generated by the code. The following folders are assumed to exist:

- `gwas`: publicly available GWAS summary statistics and liftover results

- `gencode`: [GENCODE v21](https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/release_21.html) table

- `eqtls`: BrainVar and GTEx eQTL datasets

- `g1000_eur`: 1,000 Genomes reference dataset files

- `ld_reference`: parsed LD reference data by CHR that is used in agglomerative procedure and computing Monte Carlo, empirical p-values

- `tidy_snp_gene`: SNP - gene pairs based on the different assignment types

- `inter_gene_correlation`: folder to store correlations between genes on each chromosome

- `merged_ld_loci`: agglomerative procedure results from forming LD induced loci 

- `tidy_gene_locus`: Gene - LD locus pairs based on results of agglomerative procedure

- `tidy_snp_locus`: SNP - LD locus pairs based on results of agglomerative procedure

- `locus_level_pvals`: Monte Carlo p-values for genes/loci post merging

- `adapt_model_data`: Input datasets for AdaPT with metadata for informing multiple testing correction

- `adapt_results`: Summary of AdaPT results such as lists of implicated genes, tables of SNP-gene pairs, and input/output for gene ontology enrichment analysis

- `kernel_smoothing`: Input and output datasets for kernel smoothing localization made for LD loci zoom app

- `fuma`: input and output for using FUMA on signal genes for GO enrichment (using null set matched on size)

- `revigo`: input datasets for REVIGO summary of GO terms

- `gsea`: input (gene lists test for enrichment) and output from GSEA at gene/locus level

- `app`: Temporary folder to hold app data before moving into actual shiny application folder


All datasets constructed from intermediate steps of the analysis are available upon request. 

## Results

Excel file (`association_and_enrichment_results.xlsx`) with six sheets corresponding to the selected genes/loci for each phenotype (ASD, SCZ, or EA) and positional type (Positional + eSNPs or Positional) combination, one sheet with all GSEA results, one sheet with all significant GO terms, and a glossary sheet defining each sheets' columns.
