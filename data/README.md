# Overview of data

This folder is meant contain the files necessary for analysis, as well as store
the results generated by the code. The following folders are assumed to exist:

- `gwas`: publicly available GWAS summary statistics and liftover results

- `gencode`: [GENCODE v21](https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/release_21.html) table

- `eqtls`: BrainVar and GTEx eQTL datasets

- `g1000_eur`: 1,000 Genomes reference dataset files

- `ld_reference`: parsed LD reference data by CHR that is used in agglomerative procedure and computing Monte Carlo, empirical p-values

- `tidy_snp_gene`: SNP - gene pairs based on the different assignment types

- `ld_induced_loci`: agglomerative procedure results from forming LD induced loci 

- `tidy_gene_ld_loci`: Gene - LD loci pairs based on results of agglomerative procedure

- `tidy_snp_ld_loci`: SNP - LD loci pairs based on results of agglomerative procedure

- `ld_loci_level_pvals`: Monte Carlo p-values for constructed LD loci

- `adapt_model_data`: Input datasets for AdaPT with metadata for informing multiple testing correction

- `adapt_results`: Summary of AdaPT results such as lists of implicated genes, tables of SNP-gene pairs, and input/output for gene ontology enrichment analysis

- `kernel_smoothing`: Input and output datasets for kernel smoothing localization made for LD loci zoom app

All datasets constructed from intermediate steps of the analysis are available upon request. 

## Results

The following six compressed folders contain the implicated genes and SNP-gene pairs for ASD, SCZ, and EA based on the selected LD loci (at target FDR level alpha = 0.05) with different r^2 thresholds:

- `positional_esnps_gene_ld_loci.zip`: six CSV files containing selected LD loci genes using the Positional + eSNPs assignment results

- `positional_gene_ld_loci.zip`: six CSV files containing selected LD loci genes using the Positional assignment results

- `positional_esnps_rsquared25_snp_gene_pairs.zip`: three CSV files containing selected LD loci SNP-gene pairs using the Positional + eSNPs assignment results with r^2 threshold of 0.25

- `positional_esnps_rsquared50_snp_gene_pairs.zip`: three CSV files containing selected LD loci SNP-gene pairs using the Positional + eSNPs assignment results with r^2 threshold of 0.50

- `positional_rsquared25_snp_gene_pairs.zip`: three CSV files containing selected LD loci SNP-gene pairs using the Positional assignment results with r^2 threshold of 0.25

- `positional_rsquared50_snp_gene_pairs.zip`: three CSV files containing selected LD loci SNP-gene pairs using the Positional assignment results with r^2 threshold of 0.50

Each compressed folder contains a README file providing an overview of the datasets with a column key.
